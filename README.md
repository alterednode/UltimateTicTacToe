# UltimateTicTacToe

A version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, made in Unity.

## How to play
This tic-tac-toe game consists of 9 smaller tic-tac-toe games. In order to win the game, you need to win in 3 smaller games in a row. There's a twist though, depending on which box you choose inside of one of the smaller boards, your opponent is locked to that same tile on the big board next round.

For instance, if you play in the bottom right tile of a small board, your opponent will only be able to play within the bottom right game. It's hard to explain in text, but becomes pretty clear when you play. During your turn, you can only play where the green box is.
